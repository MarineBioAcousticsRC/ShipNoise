% A routine to calculate the harmonic mean sound speed.
%    
%   z:         Vector of depth values. (m)
%   ssp:       Vector of sound speed values at the associated depths. (m/s)
%   d:         [Optional] maximum depth (m) (see below)
%
% Suppose one is given a sound speed profile (sound speeds [ssp] and depths [z]). 
% One wishes to know how long it will take a sound pulse (say from a sonar)
% to travel down through the water column. 
%
% Most people will realize that one cannot simply average the sound speeds
% and divide by the total depth. However many will incorrectly assume that
% a depth-weighted mean sound will produce the correct answer.
% Unfortunately it does not. 
%
% One must instead divide the total depth by the sum of the time it takes
% to the sound to pass through each layer of constant sound speed. This is
% called the 'harmonic mean'. The harbmonic mean is calculated like so.
%
%              |    i=n                | -1
%              |  SUM    delta z(i)    |
%              |   i=1   ---------     |
%              |            c(i)       |
% C_harmonic = |   ------------------- |
%              |    i=n                |
%              |  SUM     delta z(i)   |
%              |     i=1               |
%              |                       |
%
% When the maximum depth, 'd', is specified, two possible things may result
% depending on whether d is greater or less than the maximum depth in z.
%
% Sometimes one has a complete sound speed profile, but only needs the
% harmonic sound speed to some max depth less than the maximum depth of the
% profile. One may then specify the maximum depth as the argument 'd', and
% the function will return a harmonic mean to only that depth.
%
% Alternatively, one frequently has a sound speed profile for the upper
% portion of the water column only, but desireds a harmonic sound speed all
% the way to the bottom. Below some max depth temperature and salnity are
% constant and sound speed increases nearly linearly (to about 1 part in
% 10^4) with increasing depth. In this case, one may specify a the bottom
% depth, d. The function will then approximate the the sound speed at the
% bottom linearly from the final value in the ssp vector and calculate a
% harmonic sound speed for the entire path.
%
% When the sound speed profile is a constant linear gradient rather than 
% discrete values one can calculate the time required to traverse the
% layer directly rather than approximating the gradient in discrete steps.
% That time is given by 
%
%       1      c(i+1) 
% t =   - ln ( ------ )
%       g       c(i)
%
% This value is then added to the summation of travel times (with a
% corresponding addition to the summation of depth differences) in the
% haronic mean calculation above.

% One can optionally specify a max bottom depth. This value may be less
% than, or deeper than, the lowest depth in the z vector. If it is less than
% than z(end), the harmonic mean to the depth, d is calculated. If it is more
% than z(end), the sound speed profile is extended to the depth d using the
% first-order depth dependent term from the Mackenzie equation and the
% results of the Harmonic mean calculation for a gradient.
